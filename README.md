NEO4J on AWS EC2
----------------

CloudFormation templates that bootstrap Neo4j onto an Amazon EC2 machine, in Amazon Linux or Ubuntu flavours.  These will install the _stable_ version of Neo4j.

[Documentation](/README.CLOUDFORMATION.md)

What you'll get:
* A Neo4j Enterprise installation, with a username and password of your choosing.
* Using the OpenJDK JVM
* There's no backup (but they do write to an Amazon EBS volume)
